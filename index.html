    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>chatPsych is a Python based, open-source interface for human–AI research. It leverages widespread AI models and aims to improve the quality of research in HCI/HRI by offering an easily accessible tool for novel experiments with AI systems. <br></p>
    <p>This AI interface affords all researchers a method for experimental designs that require prompt engineering, manipulating model hyperparameters, basic model comparison, content moderation, and more.
      <br> <br> The codebase offers pre/post survey programming, randomisation of AI agent conditions, and various data collection points beyond user input prompts and model token outputs. The developer hopes to encourage science that
      reaches beyond restricted survey designs, fake stimuli, wizard of oz manipulations, or mere verbal-responses to ungeneralisable observations. chatPsych aims to encourage <strong>real</strong> interactions with <strong>real</strong> AI systems.</p>

    <p><br>chatPsych facilitates collection of a plethora of interaction data especially relevant to various human-AI interaction research. It may be easily scaled and customised for prospective behavioural research projects. Stimulus representativeness and psychological realism in relation to real-world AI systems is emphasised. 
      <br><br>This interface aims to make interaction with real-world AI systems more accessible for experimentation. Integration with Prolific, MTurk or other platforms for online sampling is easy. Moreover, non-technical experts can design and run experiments using the built-in research dashboard GUI.<br><br> 
      The incorporation of widely used AI systems into generalisable experiments is imperative for human-AI research!

    <!-- Playground Section -->
    <section id="playground" class="section">
      <h2>Playground</h2>
      <p>Try out the chatPsych interface using a randomised AI agent (Prolific_ID = -your name- Password = castle).</p>
      <p>If you want to test out making your own experiment, use the researcher login (Reseearcher_Username = admin, Researcher_Password = admin)</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>PLAYGROUND INTEGRATION STILL IN PROGRESS</p>

  <!-- Downloads Section -->
  <section id="downloads" class="section">
    <h2>Downloads</h2>
    <p>The chatPsych framework, including documentation and examples, is available on GitHub. Researchers can adapt or extend the code, incorporate new AI providers, or integrate specialized experimental features. It is free and open-source, encouraging community-driven improvements.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Oliver-Lack/chatPsych" target="_blank">chatPsych Source Code</a>
    <p>Follow the repository’s instructions for server deployment, local testing, recommended environment setup, SSL certification, and database maintenance. <br><br>
      Example adaptions like Wordie-AI also demonstrate how to run multi-condition experiments.</p>

    <p>Wordie-AI demonstrates an experiment that assigns participants to AI agent files with different temperatures, models, and system messages. It implements a 'Wordgame', 
      similar to an open-ended version of 20-questions. </p>
